# minerl_parkour
Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent that will hopefully one day learn to play a parkour obstacle course map.

Rough roadmap:
* Level 1: Straight Line Cliffwalking Lava Map
* Level 2: Easy Single Jump Cliffwalking Lava Map
* Level 3: Medium difficulty Running Jump + Cliffwalking Lava Map
* Level 4: Hard difficulty Jump + Cliffwalking Lava Map
* Level 5: Jump + Obstacles + Cliffwalking Lava Map
* Level 6: Parkour map with just running and jumping
* Level 7: Parkour map with minigames

Try getting similar or better results to OpenAI Baseline DQN and PPO models with personal implementations, then try various models and tricks to get better results.
